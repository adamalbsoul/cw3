## Coursework 3

The game was decided to be based on Dante’s Inferno, the first part of the epic poem “Divine Comedy”. 

### Character cards
The characters will be based on the ones from the poem.

### Equipment cards
These cards are not supposed to be drawn frequently(perhaps at the beginning of a circle the players can decide which equipment to keep and which to discard for other equipment cards).

The icons in the top right of the cards represent their type:

**Weapon:**

### The board

**Danger fields**:

Divided into 9 concentric circles which are further divided into 8 squares. The concept board was made in Adobe XD. It was based on a 1506 woodcut illustration by Antonio Manetti.

### End game
Reaching the end of the board ends the game.
Another iteration of the game was made as 9x8 fields (9 concentric circles divided into 8 fields) seemed a bit excessive.
